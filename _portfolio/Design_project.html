    <p> Meet Simba, a sophisticated customised Leo Rover designed to visualise and securely grasp objects upon detection. Equipped with advanced capabilities, Simba adeptly manoeuvres around obstacles and executes autonomous navigation through the integration of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) and Navigation. This project was successfully completed by a dedicated team of four. As co-leader, I was specifically responsible for realising the object grasping functionality and overseeing the systems integration, ensuring seamless operation and functionality.</p>
