This project involved using C to develop a predictive model for the Covid pandemic's progression, employing algorithms to analyze trends and project future scenarios. The results were visually represented with GNUPLOT, providing clear graphical displays of the expected pandemic trajectory. This project not only enhanced my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of data visualization techniques essential for interpreting complex datasets effectively.
