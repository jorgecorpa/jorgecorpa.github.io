This project involved developing a predictive model to forecast the progression of the Covid pandemic over time. Utilizing the C programming language, I crafted algorithms that could analyze trends and simulate potential future scenarios based on mathematical formulas. The outcomes of these predictions were visually represented through GNUPLOT, a powerful plotting tool, which allowed for clear, graphical displays of the pandemic's expected trajectory. This project not only enhanced my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of data visualization techniques essential for interpreting complex datasets effectively.
