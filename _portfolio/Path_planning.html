In the Autonomous Mobile Robot unit, I developed a project utilizing the A* pathfinding algorithm to navigate a grid where movement was restricted to four directions: up, down, left, and right. By strategically placing obstacles and start/end points on the grid, the algorithm efficiently calculated the optimal path to the destination, enhancing my understanding of robotic navigation systems.
