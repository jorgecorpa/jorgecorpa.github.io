For my undergraduate final year research project, I created an LED Solar Simulator. Basically a device that can output the light spectrum identical to the sun. The commercial solar simulators normally use Xenon Lamps, however, they waste a lot of energy. by using LEDs, I achieved to create one with a clasification of ABB according to the IEC 60904-9 compliance standard.
