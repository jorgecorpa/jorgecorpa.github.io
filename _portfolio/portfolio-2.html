    <p> For my undergraduate final year research project, I developed an LED-based Solar Simulator. This innovative device is designed to emit a light spectrum that mimics natural sunlight. Unlike traditional commercial solar simulators that rely on energy-intensive Xenon lamps, my LED model offers a more energy-efficient alternative. It was constructed to meet the IEC 60904-9 compliance standard, achieving an ABB classification. While most commercial simulators attain an AAA rating, indicating superior performance, my prototype demonstrates significant potential but requires further enhancements to reach commercial standards. This project not only reflects my commitment to sustainable technology but also underscores the possibilities for improving energy efficiency in solar simulation technology.
